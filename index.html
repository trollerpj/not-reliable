          This man ate a car thinking it was a burger.  His security cameras in his house are watching him and he tried to report it to the news authorities but they didn't want it but now they do and they asked him for it.  And they had to pay him to get it but is it a very Interesting article. This man made a burger without steak but the steak was a car and his security cameras show that he was eating it.  He ate the entire thing and had some very bad digestive issues afterwards. He reported saying that his toilet got backed up about five times having to plummet and while he was plumbing it it got backed up even more because he needed to poop more and the reason why he got backed up was pretty obvious because he ate car wich has metal in it and that would back up your toilet. Here's what the plumber had to say: “there's a toilet is was so backed up that he spent 10 hours fixing his toilet and in the middle of every time he was fixing it he came in and interrupted his work to go take a big poop on his toilet.” One of his neighbors heard very loud munching sounds and screaming noises coming from the house and like a bad neighbor they used a spyglass to peer through the window and saw that he was eating a eating a car they also saw that he put condiments on the car which is gross. They also saw their the all the wiring and stuff that was in the car was still there which can really not be good for you
